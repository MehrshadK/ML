Algorithms of machine learning in python


Here, some of the algorithms of the machine learning are implemented on the iris dataset's and two datasets produced,
one of which has two classes and one of three classes.

The Iris data collection is imported using the Python library,
and two other datasets are generated in the file data_generator_1.py and data_generator_2.py and are used in other python files.

data_generator_1.py is used to generate datasets with 2 classes and the data_generator_2.py File 2 for generating datasets with 3 classes.

The data generated are based on average and variance.
